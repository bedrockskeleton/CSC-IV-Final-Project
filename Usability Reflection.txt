I think that I have simplified my design down as much as possible; the navbar is simple, offering two distinct buttons with clear purpose. The pages themselves are condensed and to the point, minimizing scrolling and sectioning off different elements in colors that contrast while being easy on the eyes. Furthermore, clickable elements are unified under one uniform design choice; using subtle color changes and dropdown highlights to emphasize when the user is hovering over them. Initially I was going to use two fonts; one simple and round one for the headings and titles, and a more traditional serif font for the main text. That quickly changed when I found the Dosis font and discovered that it was comfortable for both bold, statement titles and smaller bodies of text. The only improvements I could see myself making is to the grid display for the charities. Working on this layout easily took half the total time I spent on the CSS section as a whole, I just couldn't get the white background to align with the end of the grid display without manual adjusting. Other than this minor setback, I'm very happy with the design that I was able to come up with.
